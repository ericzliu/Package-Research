# Package-Research
This project involves identifying and analyzing a Python package and presenting a summary and example code that demonstrates what the package can do.

## Package Summary - Textblob
In this package research project I utilized Textblob, a powerful text analysis package.
Textblob is essentially a Python library used to process textual data. It features many uses such as spelling correction, sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, etc. by providing a simple API.
Textblob acts just like traditonal Python strings, allowing users to perform various methods on specific text.

## Installing Textblob
To install Textblob, run the following commands into your terminal:

- $ pip install -U textblob
- $ python -m textblob.download_corpora

Textblob works for both Python 2 and 3.

## Supported Features and Best-Practices

As mentioned before, Textblob features many common natural langauge processing (NLP) tasks:

+ Spelling correction
+ Sentiment analysis
+ Part-of-speech tagging
+ Pluralization/Singularization
+ Lemmatization
+ Translation
+ Noun phrase extraction
+ Tokenization
+ Word and phrase frequencies
